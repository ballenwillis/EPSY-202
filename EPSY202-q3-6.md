### 3. What are your research questions?
An example of a research question for gender would be, “Would women receive
more help and attention in a hardware store than men?” Or it could be, “How does the help and attention women receive in a hardware store compare to the help and attention that men receive in a hardware store?”

How does the difficulty of transporting oneself from any given location on campus to another location for someone with a physical disability compare to someone without a physical disability?

### 4. What are your research hypotheses?
These must be predictive of your findings. For example: “We predict that women
will receive less attention than men in a hardware store compared to women.”

We predict that transporting oneself from any given location on campus to another will be substantially more difficult for someone with a physical disability.

### 5. How can this issue play a role in everyday life?

For people with one or more physical disabilities, this issue is something they deal with not only everyday, but every time they wish to go somewhere. For people who have the privilege to live without a physical disability, this is not an issue and typically does not play a role in their everyday life. However, because people with physical disabilities are typically an afterthought, not all systems to accommodate them are developed well. This causes people with disabilities attempting to use said accommodations to create slow-downs which may play a role in a physically able-bodied person's everyday life depending on the size of the population of people with a physical disability. However, people with disabilities are not to blame for these slow-downs, rather people who design these substandard accommodation systems are to blame for not considering people with disabilities more when developing transportation systems.

### 6. What is a possible competing explanation for this project?
This should be a possibility that can be an alternative to your hypotheses.

It's possible that these accomodation systems effectively and efficiently accommodate those who need them, and that people without disabilities are completely satisfied.
